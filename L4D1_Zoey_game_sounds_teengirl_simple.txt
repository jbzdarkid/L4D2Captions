"npc.TeenGirl_Generic09"
//Great, that makes me the last woman on earth.
"Player.TeenGirl_Generic10"
//You might want to rethink that, just sayin'
"Player.TeenGirl_Generic11"
//Have you guys seen any other immune women?
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic12"
//In zombie movies, the pretty girl *always* dies first.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic13"
//[kinda confidential] Francis, you're not making any sense again.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic14"
//You're an optimist. I'll give you that, Louis.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic15"

"npc.TeenGirl_Generic17"
//Yoink!
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic20"
//Zoinks!
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic21"
//Until I met you guys, I didn't know anyone else was immune.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic22"
//How did you find out you were immune?  It's a helluva test, huh?
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic23"
//Nice power tie.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic24"
//Next to you Louis, I feel kinda underdressed for this apocalypse.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic25"
//I can't get over how fast they all are. It's not even fair! I'm calling zombie bullshit on that, you know? [laughing at self] They're not allowed to be so fast.
"npc.TeenGirl_Generic26"

"npc.TeenGirl_GenericDirections09"
//Back here!
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericDirections10"
//We gotta get over this thing.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericDirections11"
//Hey Bill, at least we're going *down* the stairs.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericDirections12"
//I bet you say that to all the girls.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponse01"
//I'd kiss you... If you didn't smell like that
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponse02"
//I'd kiss you... If you weren't covered in puke.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponse03"
//Yeah, well, get over it.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses01"
//[Disbelief] What?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses02"
//You're kidding, right?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses03"
//Sure, why not?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses04"
//It couldn't get any worse, right?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses05"
//You can say that again.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses06"
//That sounds about right.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses07"
//Yeah, let's do it.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses08"
//Good thinking.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses09"
//Here we go again.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses10"
//Yeah, just us and a million zombies.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses11"
//Would you two shut up?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses12"
//[laughing] Screw you.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses13"
//If you say so.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses14"
//You're sure about this, right?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses15"
//Okay...
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses16"
//Whoa, whoa. Maybe we should think about this.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses17"
//[Deaf] WHAT?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses18"
//[Deaf] WHAT DID HE SAY?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses19"
//[Bill doesn't recognize her] I'm Zoey!
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses20"
//[Bill doesn't recognize her] Bill, it's Zoey!
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses21"
//[Player attacks her] Whoah, whoah, it's me, Zoey!
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses22"
//I don't know.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses23"
//I'm gonna let you handle that.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses24"
//I don't know. Sure.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses25"
//I don't know. Yes?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses26"
//Lemme guess: Yes?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses27"
//I don't know. No?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses28"
//Lemme guess: No?
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses29"
//That's a good point.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses30"
//Noted.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses31"
//Groovy
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses32"
//You know, they're not technically zombies - they're infected.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses33"
//The zed word - don't say it.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses34"
//It slimed me!
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses35"
//It slimed me.
"npc.TeenGirl_GenericResponses36"
//Game over man! Game over!

"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0422"
//At least one plane is working.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0501"
//We have to fuel the plane.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0502"
//Start the fuel truck!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0503"
//The plane's fueled: Let's go!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0504"
//The plane's ready!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0505"
//Starting the fuel truck...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0506"
//We can get on the plane! Let's go! Let's go!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0507"
//Hey, Ayn Rand international airport...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0508"
//Somebody really blew this place to Hell...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0509"
//What the hell happened to this place?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0510"
//*That* plane looks okay.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0511"
//Jesus, it looks like a bomb went off here. A few bombs.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport0512"
//Everyone but us is either a zombie or an asshole.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC01"
//You know, we can *make* you open that goddamn door.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC02"
//Fine.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC03"
//We've got an old man with us!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC04"
//Shhh!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC05"
//If any of us dies pumping this goddamn gas, I'm takin' it out on you.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC06"
//What a dick.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirport05NPC07"
//That plane's headed right for the airport. Maybe people are refueling there.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro01"
//That plane's headed right for the airport. Maybe they're still airlifting people out.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro02"
//That plane's headed right for the airport. Maybe they're still airlifting people out.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro03"
//That plane's headed right for the airport. Maybe they're still evacuating.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro04"
//Flying out of this place would be a lot easier than walking.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro05"
//It's worth a try.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro06"
//We can't stay up here forever.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro07"
//I hope this works out better than the helicopter.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldAirportIntro08"
//Get to the farm house!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldFarmHouse0501"
//Go, Go! Get to the farm house!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldFarmHouse0502"
//Hurry! Get to the farm house!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldFarmHouse0503"
//Fried zombies...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldFarmHouseGeneric01"
//Nice - fried zombies...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldFarmHouseGeneric02"
//The subway smelled bad, but this...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0301"
//We've go to get to the hospital.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0302"
//Into the hospital!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0303"
//There's a safe house in the hospital!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0304"
//Hurry up! Get to the hospital!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0305"
//Go, go! Get to the hospital!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0306"
//So um... yeah.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0401"
//That helicopter pilot better be here.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0402"
//Louis, you'd look good in one of those hospital gowns.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0403"
//Use the radio!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospital0501"
//We just need to get to the hospital.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric01"
//Oh boy, I pressed the button.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric02"
//Get ready, guys. Here we go.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric03"
//This is it!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric04"
//Can't that thing hurry up!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric05"
//Well, I pressed the button.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric06"
//Elevator's taking forever!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric07"
//What the hell's taking it so long?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric08"
//Dude, I pressed the button.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalGeneric09"
//Well, I guess we're going to the hospital.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldHospitalIntro01"
//I think we should keep heading away from town.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0101"
//Let's stick to the road.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0102"
//I heard the military was holding out Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0103"
//That gunfire must be from Riverside. Let's hurry.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0104"
//Sounds like Riverside's putting up a fight
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0105"
//Guess the easy way isn't an option...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0106"
//And of course the bridge is out...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0107"
//Boom! So much for the easy way.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0108"
//Oh my god!  Oh my god.  Oh my god...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0109"
//Looks like we can get back up the other side.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0110"
//Sewers, subway tunnels, turnpike tunnels,  why not?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0111"
//This way is blocked.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0112"
//I think we can go through here, guys.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0113"
//There's a building up there!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0114"
//Up here guys! Let's go!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0115"
//There's an access tunnel we can try.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0116"
//I think I know what a deer feels like all the time now.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0117"
//I heard the military's got a safe zone in Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0118"
//Gunfire! Somebody's still alive in Riverside!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0119"
//That sounds like a plan.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0120"
//Sounds good to me. Let's head to Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0121"
//Listen!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0122"
//Hear that? There's fighting in town.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0123"
//If we find a way to the surface, we can get to Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0124"
//I'm never going to be able to work on my tan am I?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0201"
//I understand why we travel at night, but why always underground?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0202"
//Up here guys!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0203"
//Through here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0204"
//Fresh air!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0205"
//Do you think those are zombie crickets?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0206"
//Safe house in the train yard!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0207"
//Safe house in the train station!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0208"
//Safe house in the train yard. Train station. Whatever it is.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0209"
//Into the caboose!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0210"
//Hang in there! I think we're getting close!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0211"
//Let's activate that bridge and get across.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0212"
//There must be a panel or something to activate that bridge.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0213"
//Okay, this is creepy.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0301"
//Not a fan of creepy old train yards.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0302"
//We can get on the other side of the fence up here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0303"
//Riverside is to our right.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0304"
//We need to get over this fence.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0305"
//Almost to Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0306"
//We need to get over this fence.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0307"
//I can't wait for a shower... for you, Francis. Jeezus.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0308"
//I don't think this barricade held...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0309"
//The town's pretty quiet. I hope that means they killed all the zombies.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0310"
//To the church!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0311"
//Are you guys ready for this?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0312"
//I always imagined the zombie apocalypse would be simpler than this.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0313"
//Ooh, a graveyard. Real scary...
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0314"
//Oh Christ, what a mess.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0315"
//I guess Riverside couldn't hold out.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0316"
//Looks like Riverside didn't hold out.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0317"
//Looks like we're getting close to Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0318"
//Riverside isn't too far from here.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0319"
//Yeah! Safehouse right up ahead, boys! We made it!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0320"
//I can see Riverside!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0321"
//There's lights on in that church!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0322"
//With our luck, this thing's built on an Indian burial ground.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0323"
//With our luck, it's built on an Indian burial ground.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0324"
//Who *is* this guy?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC01"
//If we live through this, I'm gonna kill that guy.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC02"
//Hey! Jerkass. Why don't you just open the goddamn door?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC03"
//Are you serious?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC04"
//You're not gonna just open the door? Really?
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC05"
//Not if I kill him first.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown03NPC06"
//Let's just get to the river.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0401"
//Let's get to the river and find a boat.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0402"
//I've been here before. I always liked this main street.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0403"
//Hey Louis, maybe we can find you a jacket in one of these stores.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0404"
//We can get to the river through here.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0405"
//Seriously, I never got the vest thing.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0406"
//Francis, I know how to cut hair.. just sayin...  if you need it...  I'm here....
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0407"
//So much for salvation in Riverside. Let's just get to the actual river and find a boat.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0408"
//So much for salvation in Riverside. Let's just head to the river and find a boat.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0409"
//Seriously, Nelson, I never got the vest thing
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0501"
//Someone's on the radio!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0502"
//To the boat house!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0503"
//Get to the boat house!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0504"
//I guess we make our stand in the boat house.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0505"
//Get to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0506"
//They're here! Let's go!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0507"
//They're here! Everyone to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0508"
//Get to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0509"
//To the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0510"
//C'mon guys, the boat's here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0511"
//The boat's here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0512"
//All aboard, guys!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0513"
//Come on, come on - to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0514"
//Get to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0515"
//They're here! Let's go!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0516"
//They're here! Everyone to the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0517"
//C'mon guys, the boat's here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0518"
//To the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0519"
//The boat's here!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0520"
//All aboard, guys!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0521"
//I know water scares you, Francis, but get in the boat!
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTown0522"
//Last thing I heard before they stopped broadcasting was that the military had a safe zone set up in Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTownIntro01"
//We're not far from Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTownIntro02"
//Unless anyone has a better plan, I say we head to Riverside.
"npc.TeenGirl_WorldSmallTownIntro03"
//Unless anyone has a better plan, I say we head there.
