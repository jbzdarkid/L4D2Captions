"npc.Manager_WorldHospital01" // There's the landing pad.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0101" // The Subway can take us straight to Mercy Hospital!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0102" // Subway station's just around the corner!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0103" // The Station's just up the street.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0104" // Man, you CANNOT give up.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0105" // There's the station!

"npc.Manager_WorldHospital02" // Can't this thing move any faster? (loud and quiet)
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0201" // Red Line North is the way.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0202" // We gotta take the Red Line North to Mercy Hospital.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0203" // The red line will take us to Mercy.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0204" // Damn, the line's blocked.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0205" // Tracks are blocked. We gotta find another way
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0206" // Allright, no problem. Now we gotta get out of the subway.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0207" // Safe house in the pawnshop!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0208" // Get to the pawnshop!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0209" // Safe house in the pawnshop!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0301" // Tch. I think it's this way.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0302" // Should be around here.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0303" // Excellent! We can use that lift!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0304" // Through the warehouse!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0305" // Still can't get used to this.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0306" // This is going to be messy.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0307" // Well... into the sewers we go!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0308" // Phew... Francis...
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0309" // This is not going to be sanitary.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0310" // Mercy Hospital should be right above us.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0311" // The HOSPITAL!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0312" // GET TO THE HOSPITAL!

"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0323" // Man, why'd you shoot the car!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0324" // Bet it's just a little further
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0325" // Gonna be messy.

"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0329" // Everybody, get on the lift!

"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0331" // Don't shoot the car!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0401" // This doesn't smell like a hospital...
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0402" // Were they saving people or killin' them?
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0403" // It's good for you Bill, cardio!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0404" // Elevator's here!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0405" // To the elevator!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0406" // Into the elevator!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0407" // Stay away from the edge.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0408" // Safe house through here.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0409" // We need to find access to the roof!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0410" // Roof this way!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0411" // Man, I pressed the button!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0412" // I'll call the elevator

"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0418" // We need to find roof access!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0419" // The roof's this way!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0420" // Get ready, I pressed the elevator.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0421" // Hurry up.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0501" // Let's find that radio.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0502" // Bet the chopper pilot'll be happy to hear from us!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0503" // Let's find that radio!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0504" // Big ass gun up here.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0505" // Check out this gun up here!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0506" // Well, this is it.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0507" // Get to the chopper!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0508" // Let's get out of here!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0509" // Man, I always wanted to fire one of these things.
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0510" // Man, check this gun out!
"npc.Manager_WorldHospital0511" // Man, check out this gun!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0101" // I heeard the military was evacuating people to Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0102" // Gunfire means people. We gotta hurry!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0103" // We have to get across the bridge!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0104" // Wow!  That was cool... oh wait, how do we get across?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0105" // Now that's a damn fireball!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0106" // Looks like we can get back up the other side.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0107" // The tunnel's blocked.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0108" // We have to find another way.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0109" // Man, this is messed up!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0110" // Safe house up there!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0111" // Ah, hell. The bridge is out.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0112" // Here's a way down!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0201" // These must be overflow pipes for Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0202" // Hit the button.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0203" // That'll seal the lock.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0204" // We have to lower that platform!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0205" // Safe house in the train station!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0206" // Get into the train yard!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0207" // Riverside! The military's dug in there! Shipping out refugees.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0208" // [Reading a turnpike sign] Riverside! At least we're going the right way.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0209" // Gunfire! People are fightin' back!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0210" // Hear that? Sounds like Riverside's still puttin' up a fight!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0211" // Hey, Hartford Mining! This should take us to Riverside!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0212" // Interesting true story. In 1975, the local township - [gets cut off]
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0213" // [Sees some dead survivors]They shoulda kept movin'...
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0214" // [Reading a turnpike sign] Riverside! At least we're going the right way.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0301" // Should we check up there?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0302" // Careful, this is wide open.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0303" // We can cross up here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0304" // We can use that train to cross.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0305" // Almost to Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0306" // We need to get over this fence.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0307" // I don't think getting to Riverside helped.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0308" // Goddamn it, there's gotta be some place that held out.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0309" // Get to the church!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0311" // This shit seemed cooler in movies.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0312" // Graveyards used ta spook me a little.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0313" // I think we're too late.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0314" // There I was wishin' I was in Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0315" // Can't be too much farther.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0316" // So much for Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0317" // Well, looks like we ain't gonna find any help in Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0318" // Look, there's lights on in that church!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0401" // Riverside's a bust. Let's just get to the river.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0402" // If we get to the river we can find a boat
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0403" // If you ignore the crazy guy and the zombies, nice town
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0404" // I could see coming back here once this is over
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0405" // We can get to the river through here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0406" // Riverside ain't happenin'. Let's get to the water and find a boat.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0407" // Two miles to Riverside! We're almost there!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0408" // Church still got its lights on.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0409" // But we heard gunshots less than an hour ago! There's GOTTA be someone left!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0501" // Someone's on the radio!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0502" // To the boat house!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0503" // The boat house!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0504" // We can hold out in the boat house!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0505" // Boat's here!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0506" // They're here! Let's go!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0507" // They're here! To the boat!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTown0508" // Get to the boat!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownIntro01" // I heard reports that Riverside held out!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownIntro02" // We get to Riverside and we'll probably be allright.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownIntro03" // I heard Riverside was some sorta evacuation hub.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownIntro04" // It's just a few miles from here. We oughtta check it out.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman01" // Sir, please! We are NOT infected.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman02" // Does anybody know what the hell he's talking about?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman03" // I'm getting a seriously bad vibe off this guy.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman04" // Anyone else sick of arguing with the lunatic?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman05" // Man, open the damn door!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman06" // Man, is this guy for real?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman07" // Okay, fun's over! Open the door or I am gonna hurt you!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBellman08" // Mister, if one of us get killed out here, I am gonna shoot my way in there and beat you to death with my gun!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman01" // We, uh, just need a minute to think about it, okay?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman02" // I think we should take him up on it.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman03" // I think we should take them up on it.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman04" // It's this or we wait around here. Not much of a choice.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman05" // Dunno if I trust him. Guess we ain't got much of a choice, though.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman06" // I think I'd rather take my chances with this guy than die on the shore.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman07" // Sounds like a plan. Give us a minute, alright?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman08" // Alright, you got a deal.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman09" // Okay. Deal.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman10" // Go on and head out. We're ready.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman11" // Come on and get us. We're good here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman12" // Man, that boat is takin' it's sweet time getting here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman13" // Is he paddling the boat in with his damn hands?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman14" // Come on, boat guy, hurry up!
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman15" // Come on, boat man, get in here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman16" // Boat man, get your fat ass over here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman17" // So long, Riverside.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman18" // Man, that boat is takin' it's sweet time getting here.
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman19" // Is he paddling the boat in with his damn hands?
"npc.Manager_WorldSmallTownNPCBoatman20" // Come on, boat guy, hurry up!
"Player.Manager_Yes01" // Allright.
"Player.Manager_Yes02" // Yeah.
"Player.Manager_Yes03" // Yes.
"Player.Manager_Yes04" // Yeah.
"Player.Manager_Yes05" // Okay.
"Player.Manager_Yes06" // Oh, yeah yeah Okay
"Player.Manager_Yes07" // Yeah, I'm cool with that
"Player.Manager_Yes08" // Yes
"Player.Manager_Yes09" // Cool
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome01" // Alright Cool (laughing)
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome02" // It's not a big deal.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome03" // It's fine.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome04" // Any time.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome05" // Hey, no problem.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome06" // No problem.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome07" // Sure.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome08" // Its all good.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome09" // Hey, no problem.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome10" // My pleasure.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome11" // It's all good.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome12" // It's my job.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome13" // Hey, man, no problem.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome14" // Not a problem.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome15" // You are totally welcome.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome16" // Sure thing, man.
"Player.Manager_YouAreWelcome17" // Sure
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong01" // When all this is over, you think they'll call us heroes? We are savin' humanity, right? I mean, a very small, four-person chunk of it, but still.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong02" // I ain't dyin', man. Death gonna have to pry me off the Earth.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong03" // If I go down, go on without me. Actually, wait, no  Save my ass.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong04" // If I go down, go on without me, [takes breath] get help, then come back and save me.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong06" // Look at the bright side: overpopulation? Bad economy? All fixed now.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong07" // Man, I do wish I'd bought stock in ammo manufacturers now.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong08" // I had a nice house before this. A 401k... Damn it! I had a really nice 401K!
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong09" // Zombies might have done us a favor, really. Think about it. We get to start over now.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong10" // My last life? District IT manager at Fischer Platt. Not good practice for zombie killing, you know?
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong11" // Any of you guys in the Cub Scouts? Surprisingly ineffective at preparin' you for some shit like this.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong12" // Folks I was with before you three wouldn't keep movin'. Figured they could wait it out. They couldn't.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong13" // When things go back to normal, Zoe, Bill-I'm giving you both jobs. Francis, I'll help you sign your fat ass back up on  welfare.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong14" // I ain't got time to bleed. Oh hell, I *AM* bleedin'!
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong15" // When things go back to normal, Zoe, Bill-I'm giving you both jobs. Francis, I'm gonna teach your ass how to read.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong16" // When things go back to normal, Zoe, Bill-I'm giving you both jobs. Francis, I'll help you sign back onto welfare.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong17" // I ain't got time to bleed. Oh hell, I *AM* bleedin'!
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericLong18" // When things go back to normal, Zoe, Bill-I'm giving you both jobs. Francis, I'm gonna teach you how to read.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort01" // Infected or not - they don't like bullets.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort02" // I think I just discovered a cure for infection. Lead.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort03" // We'll beat 'em 'cause we're better than them. Period.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort04" // Winning isn't everything-wantin' to win is.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort05" // Smile when it hurts the most. That's my philosophy.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort06" // Now that was a blessing in disguise.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort07" // Ahhh, probably for the best.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort08" // It'll work out in the end. You watch.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort09" // Alright, that makes us even.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort10" // Come on, cheer up! We're almost through!
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort11" // Ahhh, this ain't so bad.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort12" // I've been in worse. Not much worse though.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort13" // Well, it can only get better, right?
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort14" // Stay positive, guys! I got a good feeling about this.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort15" // We'll be laughin' about it when we get to the other side.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort16" // It's gotta be just a little farther!
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort17" // The army's gonna take care of this.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort18" // Humanity's gonna bounce right back, you watch.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort19" // Humanity ain't beat, it's just takin' a breather.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort20" // Shit, this is one long ass elevator ride.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort21" // I guess I'm just a glass-half-full guy.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort22" // Ain't no big deal, the army's gonna take care of this.
"npc.Manager_ZombieGenericShort23" // Even I can't make lemonade out of this shit.
