"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0104"
//The whole damn city's on fire.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0105"
//I sure as hell wouldn't mind flyin' outta here. Let's head to the airport.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0106"

//Get to the hotel!

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0201"

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0202"

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0203"
//We can't get across some buildings this way
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0204"
//The crane'll lower that dumpster, then we can jump across.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0205"
//We can get across on that dumpster.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0206"
//Somebody wanna lower that dumpster so we can get across?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0207"
//Somebody start the crane.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0208"
//It's down! Let's move!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0209"

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0210"
//We're gonna have to jump for it.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0211"
//Gonna have to jump it.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0212"

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0213"
//Jump!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0214"
//Down the stairs!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0215"

"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0218"
//Good job, Billy!

//Our dumpster has arrived! Let's go, girls!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0231"
//I hate jumping.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0232"
//Let's burn down this barricade.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0301"
//It figures the only thing in the damn city not on fire is the one thing we need burned down.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0302"
//THE AIRPORT!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0303"
//HELL YES, IT'S THE AIRPORT!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0304"
//Through here!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0305"
//What the hell happened to the airport?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0306"
//Well, we're here, we may as well look for a plane.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0307"
//The doors are all blocked!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0308"
//The path is clear!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0309"
//We burned a path!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0310"
//This better not be the plane we saw.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0311"
//We can get inside over the skybridge.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0312"
//There's the skybridge!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0313"
//There's a safe house across the skybridge!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0314"
//What idiot bombed the airport?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0315"
//Let's go through here.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0316"
//Ah shit, that half a plane ain't real encouraging.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0317"
//Let's burn this pile a' crap.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0318"
//THE AIRPORT! Told ya I'd get us here.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0319"
//Hey suit, this look familiar? tch tck?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0320"
//What friggin' idiot bombed the airport?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0321"
//Heh heh, hot shot.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0322"
//Never a cop when you need one.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0323"
//We need to get downstairs.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0401"
//Let's go through the offices!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0402"
//We can send the van through that pile a' crap.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0403"
//We gotta get through that pile a' junk.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0404"
//Big pile a' luggage. Lotta good it did em.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0405"
//We need ta be on the other side of that pile a' crap.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0406"
//Why would the army bomb the airport?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0407"
//Get outta the damn metal detector!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0408"
//Maybe your belt buckle set that off.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0409"
//Bill? I was the one that said that.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0410"
//What do you mean it's just like the army?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0411"
//There's the plane we saw!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0412"
//Let's get down to that plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0413"
//There's the plane! How the hell do to it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0414"
//I hate Ayn Rand.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0416"
//You think my belt buckle set it off?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0417"
//Here's a crazy idea: What if we send the van into that pile of junk?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0418"
//We need to get out to the runway.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0419"
//We gotta get to the runway.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0420"
//This is the most sober I've ever been in an airport.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0421"
//That skybridge will get us over.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0422"
//There's the plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0423"
//The sad thing is this is only the second worst time I've ever had in an airport.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0424"
//I hate vans.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0425"
//God's dead, huh? Well, join the damn club.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0426"
//Holy shit... that wasn't our plane was it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0427"
//I'm a little scared of flyin' now.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0428"
//What's the chance that'll happen twice in a row?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0429"
//That plane looks like it's still workin'
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0501"
//We gotta gas up the plane.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0502"
//Starting the fuel truck...
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0503"
//Start the fuel truck!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0504"
//The plane's gassed up: Let's go!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0505"
//The plane's ready!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0506"
//Plane's ready! Let's go! Let's go!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0507"
//Somebody really blew this place to Hell...
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0509"
//What the hell happened to this place?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0510"
//*That* plane looks okay.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0511"
//Jesus, it looks like a bomb went off here. A few bombs.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0512"
//I hate planes.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0513"
//Everyone but us is either a zombie or an asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC01"
//Listen candy-pants, we can *make* you open that goddamn door.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC02"
//Fine.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC03"
//Have a heart, we gotta a helpless old man with us!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC04"
//[under your breath] Shut up, Bill.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC05"
//If anybody dies pumpin' this goddamn gas, I'm takin' it out on you.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC06"
//Everyone but us is either a vampire or an asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC07"
//I'm votin' asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC08"
//Are you kidding me?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC09"
//Yeah, yeah, we get it.  You're a hero.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC10"
//Listen asshole, I can fly the plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC11"
//Why don't you come out here and prove it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC12"
//Sir, Terry's dead. And we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC13"
//Terry didn't make it, pal.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC14"
//We can do that.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC15"
//Hell, we can do that.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC16"
//You just make sure the damn thing is ready to fly.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC17"
//Sir, uh, we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC18"
//Sir, uh, we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC19"
//Jackass.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC20"
//Don't make me come over there and open up a can of whoopass.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC21"
//Yer tellin' me people camp for fun?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0101"
//All right.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0102"
//We gotta be close to the outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0103"
//If we can find some tracks, we can follow em to the military outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0104"
//Shit. Never thought I'd go lookin' for the military.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0105"
//Bet you kids cross shit like this for fun.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0106"
//Nice place.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0107"
//There's the tracks. Now we just need to get to 'em.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0108"
//Bet we can get to the tracks from that building.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0109"
//There's a safe house back here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0110"
//Man I hate the woods.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0111"
//I hate the woods.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0112"
//Bridge's out.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0113"
//Woah...Okay... all we need to do is find the rail road tracks.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0114"
//Nice day for a picnic.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0115"
//Bridge's out. Terrific.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0116"
//Louis, what's scarier: zombies or goin' back to work in an office?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0201"
//We can get down to the tracks over here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0202"
//Looks like this tunnel heads the right way.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0203"
//This tunnel heads the right way.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0204"
//The tracks are down from here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0205"
//Through here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0206"
//Well, goddamnit, the tracks are blocked.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0207"
//Let's try this tunnel.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0208"
//Maintenance corridor up here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0209"
//Damn tracks are blocked!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0210"
//I hate trains.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0211"
//I hate tunnels.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0212"
//Louis, what's scarier: vampires or goin' back to work in an office?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0213"
//The tracks should just be downstairs.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0214"
//These things are a real frickin' maze. I hate mazes.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0301"
//This better go through.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0302"
//Watch out for that fence.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0303"
//Nice, they electrified the fence.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0304"
//Hey Pointdexter, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0305"
//Hey suit, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0306"
//Woaah, fried.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0307"
//Start the engine.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0308"
//Hey, unhook that car.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0309"
//Get that thing moving!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0310"
//Hit it!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0311"
//Watch out for the train!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0312"
//We can get up there now!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0313"
//Up there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0314"
//Safe house up there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0315"
//There might be supplies in that house.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0316"
//Let's check this house.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0317"
//There's the tracks!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0318"
//Track's blocked again. Looks like they curve around that hill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0319"
//Let's hump our asses over the hill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0320"
//God DAMN I hate electric fences.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0321"
//Yo, you in the monkey suit, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0322"
//This is a real freakin' maze.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0323"
//There're some trains back here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0324"
//There's some trains back there
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0325"
//You know - I bet we could knock that bridge down.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0326"
//We need to get up there.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0327"
//Barn ahead!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0401"
//Any supplies in the barn?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0402"
//Let's check out the barn.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0403"
//Is Arnold in there?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0404"
//Never rmind, I forgot, you guys are like 10 years old. 'Cept you, Bill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0405"
//The tracks!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0406"
//Another building!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0407"
//The tracks should be down there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0408"
//Train station
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0409"
//This better not be the military outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0410"
//This is all messed up.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0411"
//We can get around down here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0412"
//Someone get the gate.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0413"
//Open the gate!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0414"
//Across the bridge, GO!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0415"
//Run for the train car!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0416"
//Get to the goddam train car!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0417"
//Yeah, the caboose!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0418"
//I have NEVER liked barns.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0419"
//I hate barns.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0420"
//Get to the farm house!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0501"
//An outpost!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0502"
//Yeah, we made it!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0503"
//Up the hill!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0504"
//Finally!  We're getting out of here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0505"
//I don't like this...
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0506"
//Somethin's not right...
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0507"
//Pick up the radio.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0508"
//What's this shit?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0509"
//Well, I'm callin' em, this is it.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0510"
//We just gotta wait until they show up.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0511"
//Army's here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0512"
//Look at that shit!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0513"
//That's some fire power!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0515"
//Ladies, I do believe we have been saved.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0517"
//Guns in the barn!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0518"
//Yeah, army's here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0519"
//We walk 500 miles, kill 10,000 zombies just to make it to a goddamn tape loop?  Screw the army.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0521"
//These guys better not take long. I've had it.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0522"
//I forgive you, Army. I love you guys!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0523"
//That is one creepy ass house.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0524"
//You got to be shittin me.  We walk a hundred miles, fight 5 million vampires -
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0525"
//Goddamn tape loop piece of shit.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0526"
//-whatever. And all they got is a goddamn tape loop? Screw the goddamn army.

//Fried zombies...
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseGeneric01"
//Hey, fried zombies... tasty
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseGeneric02"
//I heard the military's got a safe zone north of here. We just gotta follow the train tracks.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro01"
//I knew that idiot couldn't fly a plane. Everybody in one piece?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro02"
//Yeah, I heard that, too.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro03"
//You got a better plan?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro04"
//We ain't gonna survive on our own forever. I heard the military's got a safe zone north of here. We just gotta follow the train tracks.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro05"
//Listen, the government's got a hate-free zone up north... I'm kidding, the military's got a stronghold up there and they're killing anything that walks funny. Railroad tracks should take us right there.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro06"
//Uh, hello?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmhouseNPC01"
//Attention Army: This is the cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmhouseNPC02"

//There's a safe house in the hospital!
"npc.Biker_WorldHospital0303"
//Hit the button!
"npc.Biker_WorldHospital0304"
//Get on the lift!
"npc.Biker_WorldHospital0305"
