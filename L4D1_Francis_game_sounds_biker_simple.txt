"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0413" // Let's get down to that plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0414" // There's the plane! How the hell do to it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0416" // I hate Ayn Rand.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0417" // You think my belt buckle set it off?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0418" // Here's a crazy idea: What if we send the van into that pile of junk?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0419" // We need to get out to the runway.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0420" // We gotta get to the runway.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0421" // This is the most sober I've ever been in an airport.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0422" // That skybridge will get us over.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0423" // There's the plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0424" // The sad thing is this is only the second worst time I've ever had in an airport.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0425" // I hate vans.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0426" // God's dead, huh? Well, join the damn club.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0427" // Holy shit... that wasn't our plane was it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0428" // I'm a little scared of flyin' now.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0429" // What's the chance that'll happen twice in a row?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0501" // That plane looks like it's still workin'
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0502" // We gotta gas up the plane.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0503" // Starting the fuel truck...
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0504" // Start the fuel truck!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0505" // The plane's gassed up: Let's go!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0506" // The plane's ready!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0507" // Plane's ready! Let's go! Let's go!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0509" // Somebody really blew this place to Hell...
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0510" // What the hell happened to this place?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0511" // *That* plane looks okay.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0512" // Jesus, it looks like a bomb went off here. A few bombs.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport0513" // I hate planes.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC01" // Everyone but us is either a zombie or an asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC02" // Listen candy-pants, we can *make* you open that goddamn door.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC03" // Fine.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC04" // Have a heart, we gotta a helpless old man with us!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC05" // [under your breath] Shut up, Bill.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC06" // If anybody dies pumpin' this goddamn gas, I'm takin' it out on you.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC07" // Everyone but us is either a vampire or an asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC08" // I'm votin' asshole.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC09" // Are you kidding me?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC10" // Yeah, yeah, we get it.  You're a hero.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC11" // Listen asshole, I can fly the plane!
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC12" // Why don't you come out here and prove it?
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC13" // Sir, Terry's dead. And we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC14" // Terry didn't make it, pal.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC15" // We can do that.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC16" // Hell, we can do that.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC17" // You just make sure the damn thing is ready to fly.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC18" // Sir, uh, we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC19" // Sir, uh, we're cops.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC20" // Jackass.
"npc.Biker_WorldAirport05NPC21" // Don't make me come over there and open up a can of whoopass.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0101" // Yer tellin' me people camp for fun?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0102" // All right.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0103" // We gotta be close to the outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0104" // If we can find some tracks, we can follow em to the military outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0105" // Shit. Never thought I'd go lookin' for the military.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0106" // Bet you kids cross shit like this for fun.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0107" // Nice place.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0108" // There's the tracks. Now we just need to get to 'em.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0109" // Bet we can get to the tracks from that building.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0110" // There's a safe house back here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0111" // Man I hate the woods.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0112" // I hate the woods.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0113" // Bridge's out.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0114" // Woah...Okay... all we need to do is find the rail road tracks.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0115" // Nice day for a picnic.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0116" // Bridge's out. Terrific.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0201" // Louis, what's scarier: zombies or goin' back to work in an office?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0202" // We can get down to the tracks over here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0203" // Looks like this tunnel heads the right way.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0204" // This tunnel heads the right way.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0205" // The tracks are down from here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0206" // Through here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0207" // Well, goddamnit, the tracks are blocked.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0208" // Let's try this tunnel.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0209" // Maintenance corridor up here!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0210" // Damn tracks are blocked!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0211" // I hate trains.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0212" // I hate tunnels.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0213" // Louis, what's scarier: vampires or goin' back to work in an office?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0214" // The tracks should just be downstairs.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0301" // These things are a real frickin' maze. I hate mazes.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0302" // This better go through.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0303" // Watch out for that fence.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0304" // Nice, they electrified the fence.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0305" // Hey Pointdexter, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0306" // Hey suit, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0307" // Woaah, fried.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0308" // Start the engine.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0309" // Hey, unhook that car.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0310" // Get that thing moving!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0311" // Hit it!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0312" // Watch out for the train!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0313" // We can get up there now!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0314" // Up there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0315" // Safe house up there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0316" // There might be supplies in that house.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0317" // Let's check this house.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0318" // There's the tracks!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0319" // Track's blocked again. Looks like they curve around that hill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0320" // Let's hump our asses over the hill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0321" // God DAMN I hate electric fences.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0322" // Yo, you in the monkey suit, hit the power.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0323" // This is a real freakin' maze.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0324" // There're some trains back here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0325" // There's some trains back there
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0326" // You know - I bet we could knock that bridge down.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0327" // We need to get up there.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0401" // Barn ahead!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0402" // Any supplies in the barn?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0403" // Let's check out the barn.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0404" // Is Arnold in there?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0405" // Never rmind, I forgot, you guys are like 10 years old. 'Cept you, Bill.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0406" // The tracks!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0407" // Another building!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0408" // The tracks should be down there!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0409" // Train station
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0410" // This better not be the military outpost.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0411" // This is all messed up.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0412" // We can get around down here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0413" // Someone get the gate.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0414" // Open the gate!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0415" // Across the bridge, GO!

"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0501" // Get to the farm house!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0502" // An outpost!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0503" // Yeah, we made it!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0504" // Up the hill!
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0505" // Finally!  We're getting out of here.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0506" // I don't like this...
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0507" // Somethin's not right...
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0508" // Pick up the radio.

"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0510" // Well, I'm callin' em, this is it.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouse0511" // We just gotta wait until they show up.

"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseGeneric02" // Hey, fried zombies... tasty
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro01" // I heard the military's got a safe zone north of here. We just gotta follow the train tracks.

"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro03" // Yeah, I heard that, too.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro04" // You got a better plan?
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro05" // We ain't gonna survive on our own forever. I heard the military's got a safe zone north of here. We just gotta follow the train tracks.
"npc.Biker_WorldFarmHouseIntro06" // Listen, the government's got a hate-free zone up north... I'm kidding, the military's got a stronghold up there and they're killing anything that walks funny. Railroad tracks should take us right there.

"npc.Biker_WorldSmallTown0103" // Gunfire! Somebody's still alive in Riverside!
"npc.Biker_WorldSmallTown0104" // That sounds like a plan.
"npc.Biker_WorldSmallTown0105" // Sounds good to me. Let's head to Riverside.
"npc.Biker_WorldSmallTown0106" // Hear that? There's fightin' in town.
"npc.Biker_WorldSmallTown0107" // If we find a way to the surface, we can get to Riverside.
