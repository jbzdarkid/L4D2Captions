//Folks call me Ellis. I run an auto shop with a couple of my buddies. We're also in a band. I play bass.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B132"
//Folks call me Ellis. I run an auto shop around here. Instead of evacuatin, I armored up a truck to drive myself out of here. Built that thing to be zombie proof.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B133"
//Turns out it was only 99% zombie proof. The last 1% tore that truck to SHIT.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B134"
//You don't say? Wrestlin' and such?
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B135"
//Huh. If everybody's evacuatin', who's watchin the news?

"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B33"
//Did anyone else notice this building is on fire?
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B34"
//Ah hell, this is just messed up.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M1B35"

"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B17"
//That man is the pride of Georgia.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B20"
//That man is America's greatest natural resource.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B21"
//I would take a bullet for that man.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B22"
//If the laws of nature allowed it, I would bear that man's children.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B23"
//That man is an American hero.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B24"
//That's Jimmy Gibbs, Jr. The greatest driver ever to climb into a stock car.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B25"
//Aw, shit, we missed him! This apocalypse is startin' to piss me off..
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B26"
//Aw, shit, we missed him? That is the last straw-these zombies have just made an enemy.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B27"
//Aw, hell. I coulda got my picture taken with Jimmy Gibbs' stock car? I HATE this apocalypse.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B28"
//God damn it. I coulda got my picture taken with Jimmy Gibbs' stock car.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B29"
//Check it, y'all! Jimmy Gibbs Jr.!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B30"
//I got a feelin' this alarm ain't gonna go unnoticed.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B32"
//Get ready! The alarm is gonna sound.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B33"
//Keep going!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B34"
//UP, UP! Keep goin' UP!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B35"
//We have to turn that alarm off!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B36"
//Somebody turn off the alarm!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B37"
//Someone turn off the alarm!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B38"
//I Got it!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B39"
//My ears aint never gonna stop ringing.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B41"
//Looks like we'll have to get out of the city on our own.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B42"
//Doesn't look like we're getting rescued.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B43"
//Looks like a slaughterhouse in here...
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B44"
//Man, this is... this is awful.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B45"
//The only folks gonna save us is ourselves.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B46"
//If we're gonna get out of here, we're gonna have to do it ourselves.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B47"
//Hey, right up here! Some of the refugees built a safe room!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M3B48"
//Actually, I been thinking...
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B01"
//I might have an idea.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B02"
//If you're looking for ideas, look no further. Because I have a good one.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B04"
//Let's go find Jimmy Gibbs' stock car. We get that thing gassed up, we can drive out of here.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B05"
//So I been thinking. Jimmy Gibbs' stock car's around here somewhere. We just gotta find it, gas it up, and I'll drive that thing to New Orleans my damn self.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B06"
//I've got an idea. You know them posters we been seein? Get your picture taken with Jimmy Gibbs' stock car? That means it's HERE. We just need to appropriate it, and we got ourselves an escape vehicle.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B07"
//Listen up. See that poster! Says here you can get your picture taken with Jimmy Gibbs stock car. All we gotta do is find it, gas it up, and drive out of here ourselves!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B08"
//I've got an idea. Jimmy Gibbs, Jr. ain't gonna mind if we borrow his stock car. He's a very generous man.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B09"
//Yeah, yeah, yeah. All we gotta do is find it and gas it up, and I'll drive us out of here my damn self.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B10"
//Y'all remember those ads we saw on the way in? I think I got an idea how to get us some wheels.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B11"
//That's Jimmy Gibbs, Jr, and yes. We find his stock car, get it gassed up? I'll drive us out of here myself.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B12"
//Only if I get kilt. Otherwise you better kill me, cause I'M driving.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B13"
//I actuallly think the guy who came up with the idea should get to drive the stock car.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B14"
//It was my idea!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B15"
//Now remember: They don't fill up the tanks at car shows, so we'll have to find some gas.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B17"
//Alright, I'm bettin' the gas tank'll probably be empty. We'll have to gas it up before we can haul ass.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B18"
//Now, this ain't the first time I've tried to peel out of a car show. Turns out they usually leave the tanks empty for just such an eventuality. We gonna have to gas it up.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B19"
//Wherever he is, Coach-he's proud of you.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B20"
//Remember the plan. Grab gas, fill up the tank, and let's get out of here.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B23"
//Soon as these doors open... get ready to run.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B24"
//Go! Go! Go! Find some gas!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B25"
//Come comeoncomeoncomeon...
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B30"
//Please get in the tank, please please please...
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B31"
//C'mon, hurrrry up up up up up...
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B32"
//Man I feel like I'm gassin' up royalty.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B33"
//This is... such an honor.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B34"
//Man, never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be gassin' up Jimmy Gibb's car.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B35"
//I'll be drivin' you REALLLL soon, girl.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B37"
//I can't wait to get behind your wheel, darlin'.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B38"
//Come onnnn, come onnnnnn...Fill it up here!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B39"
//Grab a gas can and fill 'er up!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B40"
//Find a gas can!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B41"
//Find a gas can!

"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B57"
//Let's get outta here!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B58"
//Let's go! I'm driving! WOOO!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B59"

"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B65"
//Jimmy Gibbs Jr. I will do this for you.
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B66"
//Here we go folks! Buckle up, I aim to see what this car can DO!
"Mechanic_WorldC1M4B67"
//Bus is blocking the way.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M105"
//Hey, down this off ramp.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M106"
//Ain't nobody been swimmin' in this pool for a while.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M110"
//We can get around back through here.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M112"
//Hey, search the rooms.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M113"
//Check the rooms.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M114"
//Whoa hey!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M119"
//WHOOOAA!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M120"
//That's a righteous ride down that hill.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M121"
//Anybody wanna go back up and do that again?
"Mechanic_WorldC2M122"
//Coach, you're breathin a little hard, you okay?
"Mechanic_WorldC2M123"
//Sorry, folks. This car's capable of miracles, but it can't drive over twenty miles of parked cars. I think we're walkin'.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B01"
//Hey guys, can I have a second? Alone with the car? I just... I got some things that need saying.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B03"
//We had a good time.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B05"
//You are the most beautiful thing I have ever sat between.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B07"
//Man. This was the best day of my life.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B08"
//I love you.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B09"
//Thank you. We couldn't have done it without you.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B10"
//Thank you.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B11"
//Well, this is it. Let's not make it harder than it needs to be.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B12"
//Well, this isn't the way I saw it, but I'm sorry I'm gonna have to leave you here.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B13"
//You did good.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B14"
//Sorry, guys. Guess it wasn't such a hot idea after all.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B17"
//Searchlights. That's the first sign of life we've seen in a hundred miles.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B18"
//We should head towards those searchlights.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B19"
//Down this off ramp!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B20"
//That'd be Whispering Oaks Amusement Park, right there.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B22"
//Highway's blocked! Let's cut through the motel!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B25"
//Look at those poor people. All they wanted to do was go for a swim.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B26"
//Look at all those poor people.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B27"
//Search the rooms.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B28"
//Check the rooms! Might be crap in em!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B29"
//Hey watch your footing. This gully looks steep.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B31"
//If we're gonna get to the bottom of this gully, we gotta be careful.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B32"
//Whispering Oaks! We made it!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M1B33"
//Whoa! Sorry Rochel!e!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M201"
//I never once thought a merry-go-round would turn on me.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M203"
//I mean, what is this world coming to when you dread a merry-go-round?
"Mechanic_WorldC2M204"
//Can we stop and make some cotton candy? Seriously.

"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B06"
//Uh, yeah, they're a pretty big deal, alright.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B09"
//I heard when they play? You can see the show from SPACE.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B10"
//I heard they gotta cancel the concert if there's a breeze, cause any town downwind'll catch on FIRE.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B11"
//Man, would you look at all these rides? And no LINES! Wish we weren't in such a hurry.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B12"
//It's like we bought the park and got every ride to ourselves! That's the third thing I was gonna do if I ever won the lottery.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B13"
//I wanna ride one! Just one! Just lemme ride the Screaming Oak once. Man, when we ever gonna be here again?
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B14"
//Man, how can you not like Lil Peanut? I love this little guy!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M2B15"

"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B01"
//Coach, you are a brilliant man.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B02"

"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B03"
//And that'll signal the chopper pilot! This is gonna be like the FOURTH time the Midnight Riders have saved my life.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B04"
//I'm in. Let's rock and roll.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B05"
//I'm in. This arena's about to get rocked.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B06"
//A Midnight Riders show aint about the MUSIC, Nick. It's about the explosions.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B12"
//That don't matter. I could never hear the music over the protechnics anyway.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B13"
//Lots of bands lip sync. Aint nothing wrong with saving your vocal cords for the studio.
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B14"
//Ooh, here's a tape deck marked finale!
"Mechanic_WorldC2M5B15"
//When I hit this tape deck, it's all gonna start. Get ready, guys!

//Alright, stay on the walkways.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M161"
//Ooh - you could try covering yourself in mud...
"Mechanic_WorldC3M162"
//We should be all right if we stay on the walkways.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M163"
//Alright, careful, careful, that looks pretty rickety.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M164"
//Anyone wanna pick a way to go?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M165"
//Left or right my friends?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M166"
//Hey, we gotta get back to the walkway!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M167"
//Stairs!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M168"
//Hey, get back up there!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M169"
//Hey, Let's get back up there!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M170"
//Let's just stay on the walkway.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M171"
//Hey, don't get off the walkway, okay?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M172"
//I don't like not being on the walkway.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M173"
//Have you smelled yourself recently?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M174"
//Alright, let's all try to the right.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M177"
//Dude, they must have gone this way.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M178"
//Tour ended here.   I think we gotta keep moving.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M179"
//Planks this way.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M180"
//Hey, path to the right.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M181"
//I had no plans on feeding the gators.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M182"
//Hey, lights on over here!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M184"
//Lights by the drainage ditch!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M185"
//Safehouse, we gotta be going the right way!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M186"
//Nick does have a point.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B01"
//Nick, what the hell you shot the pilot!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B02"
//True. True. He was a zombie. But he was also the only pilot.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B03"
//OOOH man, that was some crazy shit. Nick, you are a man of action! ... Where the hell are we?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B04"
//Guess our crash was so soft cause we landed in the
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B06"
//Swimming with gators? Why no thank you.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B07"
//Hey, guys. Be honest. Are my muscles gettin' bigger?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B08"
//I knew it. All this runnin' around climbin' up on stuff's makin' me buff as hell.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B09"
//Y'all ask me? These swamp people got it all figured out, man. No cops, no rules...
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B11"
//They figured out how to stop going to the bathroom? That's AMAZING. Ohhhh. No, wait, I just got it. Shit, that's gross as hell.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M1B12"
//Time to get wet.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M204"
//Dry land up here.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M205"
//It's quicker on the dry land.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M206"
//Yeah, very funny.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M212"
//What's a parachutist doing out here?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M213"
//Why would he parachute out here?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M214"
//Holy shit. Well this explains our parachutist.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M215"
//Goddamn a whole plane!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M217"
//Had to be scary to be on this flight.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M218"
//Yo, we got to go through this emergency door.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M219"
//Looks like this emergency door is the only way.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M220"
//I just know an alarm is gonna sound when we open that door.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M221"
//Get ready and lets open the door.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M222"
//Alright, we ready to open the door?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M223"
//Somebody has to open this door.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M224"
//All hell, I'm opening it.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M225"
//Alright, get ready y'all, I'm openin' the door!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M226"
//Jesus Christ, did they really build these houses underwater?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M227"
//Man, there is just garbage everywhere.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M228"
//Wow, this here is some real shacks.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M229"
//Hey, there's a road!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M230"
//Hey man, lights on!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M231"
//Hey you see those lights?

//Mud people!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M234"
//Are you shittin' me now? Mud people?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M235"
//I got a new thing I hate: mud people.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M236"
//Tell you what, mud people take all the fun out of the mud.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M237"
//There's the village!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M238"
//They have lights on in the village!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M239"
//They could have held out!

"Mechanic_WorldC3M248"
//Hello! Anyone here?!
"Mechanic_WorldC3M249"

"Mechanic_WorldC3M251"
//Shit, man. They didn't make it.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M301"
//Zombies got here too.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M302"
//Man, I don't think we're ever gonna get good news again.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M303"
//Well.. let's look for supplies.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M304"
//Maybe they left some around here.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M305"
//Looks like they all headed off to a plantation.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M306"
//No sense hanging out here.
"Mechanic_WorldC3M308"
//Hey, is there a way out of the village?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M309"
//So they just killed them?
"Mechanic_WorldC3M310"
